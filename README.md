# MindMap (on developing)

A simple mindmap web application based on react and redux.

if you want to try it by yourself, clone it and run those commands in your terminal:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your favorite modern browser.

have fun!

PS: if you have seen some error about React-Draggable's references to the variable `global`, don't worry, it has been fixed already, but the author has
not published yet. remove the `global` variable by yourself!
